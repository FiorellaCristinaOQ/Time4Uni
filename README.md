### Organization as a tool to transform student's lives

In this repository you will find the code for Time4Uni, a powerful organization and mental health app designed to help college students to put their life together and find a balance between their academic and personal life. We chose Flutter to developed the app, due to its ease of use and versatility; as we are still beginners with mobile development and programming in general, it was really helpful to have such a good and fast to learn Google technology available.

Feel free to download our code and try it in your own machine ;D
