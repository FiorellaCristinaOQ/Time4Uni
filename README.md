### *Organization as a tool to transform student's lives*

In this repository you will find the code for Time4Uni, a powerful organization and mental health app designed to help college students to put their life together and find a balance between their academic and personal life. We chose Flutter to developed the app, due to its ease of use and versatility; as we are still beginners with mobile development and programming in general, it was really helpful to have such a good and fast to learn Google technology available.

Feel free to download our code and try it in your own machine ;D

## What was our motivation?

Academic stress among university students has always been a major issue, but with the arrival of the covid-19 pandemic, things got even worse. Mental health is related to poor organizational strategies and cuestionable lifestyle choices. Students usually want to achieve academic and professional success so much that they forget about their inner value and stop scheduling time for activities that they find meaningful and that bring happiness to their lives. They need to have a good balance of their personal and academic life to avoid developing mental health problems or even worse. Recently, scientific studies have reported the increase of suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts among students due to the pandemic.

Our goal here is to get university students to finally realize that personal life is in no way interfering with academic life, they both complement each other and we cannot ignore one of them. What our solution wants to do in addition to the organization part is to help students to be aware of the inner relation between academic life and personal life, both of them important in their own way to help students accomplish their goals. At the same time we provide useful tips and techniques to deal with the most common problems that students may face during their time at university, so they can be prepared and in the future they will already know how to deal with these kinds of situations. By combining organization tools as a digital agenda and a todo list with tips, tricks and testimonials for and from people who have experienced academic stress and professionals in the field, we will help many students to deal with the hard part of going to university, make their life easier and more fulfilling, with motivation and more time available to build important connections with their classmates, to practice sports and take care of their physical health, among many other benefits.

## The bright future we see

There are plenty of functionalities that we still want to implement. First, we want to improve our design, so the app can look more aesthetically pleasing and catch the attention of more potential users. Second, we want to add more functionality to the organization tools and make the health and community pages more interactive. For example, when the user wants to fill its schedule with tons of classes and hours of study time, the app should be able to politely suggest not to do that. Also, the extra pages that we want to implement are called evaluations, deadlines and habits, to keep track of important dates and to start building new positive habits to improve students' lifestyles. Third, we want to validate the advice given to the users by professionals in the field of mental health, to make sure that we are tackling the problem in the right way. Finally, our future plans for when the app is finished include working with universities to reach a wider range of users and go directly to where our users are and not wait until they find us by chance.
